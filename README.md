# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Project Title: Horiseon

Horiseon is a marketing agency that had requested for their website's accessibility to be optimized for search engines. In an effort to accomodate the client's request for clear and concise code, I have refactored the original HTML and CSS codes to organize and consolidate code for an improved codebase in the long-run. There were aspects of the coding that lacked accessibility for all users, so I included alt attributes to ensure that Horiseon can be accessible even for users that require assistive technologies.
